# ðŸ”Œ STM32 1-Wire Protocol (iButton Interface)

This project implements the 1-Wire communication protocol using **STM32 HAL** to interface with 1-Wire devices like the **iButton (DS1990A)**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Bit-level 1-Wire protocol implementation (read/write/reset)
- Manual open-drain simulation using GPIO direction control
- Accurate timing using `delay_us()` function
- Compatible with STM32CubeIDE and HAL
